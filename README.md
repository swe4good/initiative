# initiative

We are a group of experienced software engineers aiming to contribute our expertise for the greater good during our spare time. Our mission is to establish a volunteer network comprising software engineers, project managers, and other tech professionals to provide free engineering services to schools, charities, and non-profit organizations.

Our services encompass web development, application building, and various software solutions tailored to the needs of socially-conscious organizations. In contrast to conventional volunteer groups within companies, our focus lies in the seamless delivery of high-quality services through effective coordination and collaboration among our diverse volunteer base.

We understand the demanding workloads our fellow engineers face in their regular jobs. By distributing tasks across our network, we strive to enable a broader range of tech professionals to engage in impactful volunteer work without overwhelming individual commitments.

This repository is used to initiate service request from users. Services themselves will be managed in individual repositories. Non-profit entities seeking pro-bono engineering support are welcome to start an issue.

If you resonate with our cause and wish to join our mission, please reach out to us at join@swe4good.org.
